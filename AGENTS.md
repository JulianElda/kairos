# General

- Filenames must be kebab-case.
- Files of the same feature or domain can be indicated with `.`, e.g. `my-component.ts`, `my-component.types.ts`, `my-component.api.ts`.
- Shared utilities must be domain scoped, e.g. `string.utils.ts`, `api.utils.ts`, `build.utils.ts`.
- Keep formatting and linting aligned with the shared lexis preset used by oxfmt and oxlint.
- Use `bun` for package management.
- Prefer named exports instead of default exports, e.g. `export function MyFunction()`.

# TypeScript

- Keep strict typing. Avoid any and avoid type assertions unless there is no safer option.
- Use type-only imports for TypeScript types: `import type { MyType } from '...'`.
- Prefer undefined over null, except when it is required by external libraries.
- Prefer interface for public object shapes; use type for unions, intersections, and advanced types.
- A type file should be named `{domain|feature}.types.ts` and placed where it is relevant.
- Prefer `Record` over index signature, e.g. `type RecordType = Record<string, number>;`

# Svelte

- Declare component props using the `$props()` rune with an interface immediately above the component script.
- Name props interfaces as `ComponentNameProps` (e.g., `HeaderProps`, `ButtonProps`).
- Destructure props using the `const { prop1, prop2 } = $props()` pattern immediately after the script tag.
- Use `$effect()` for reactive side effects; avoid reactive blocks (`$:`) for clarity.
- Name event handlers descriptively with `handle` prefix: `handleClick`, `handleChange`, `handleSubmit`.
- Order attribute name alphabetically.
- Order element attributes alphabetically.
- Keep components small and focused with single responsibility; extract logic into separate components or utility functions.
- Return/conditional-render early for empty, loading, or error states using `{#if}` blocks.
- Use `let` for component state; prefer `let` over module-level variables to scope state.
- Prefer Svelte runes.

# Styling

- Use utility-first class composition patterns consistently.
- Reuse shared UI components before creating new variants.

# Testing

- Prefer inlining test values. Use shared mock data directly when it is intended for reuse across tests or Storybook, and avoid creating local copies unless the test needs to mutate the data.
- Do not wrap tests in a file in a `describe()`.
- Use `test`, not `it`.
- When multiple async assertions are independent, run them in a single Promise.all instead of sequential awaits. Keep sequential awaits only when assertion order matters, user interactions change state between checks, or clearer failure isolation is needed.
